This tutorial shows how a simple Hydra app is developed in Python. Hydra
apps connect to Hydra Platform through a `SOAP
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP>`_ interface. Developing a app in any
other programming language that provides SOAP libraries should be similar to the
code presented here.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Python or any other programming
language.
