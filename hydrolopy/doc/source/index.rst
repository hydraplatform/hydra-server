This collection of scripts provides basic functionality for the handling of
hydrology or other time series data. It also features a class which provides a
consistent handling of reservoirs, including hydrological, hydraulic and
economical properties.

This package still under heavy development. Many submodules are far from being
complete. However the structure as it is allows to flexibly expand the package
functionality.

Information on how to download and install the code is found in the
:ref:`download-and-install` section.

Development is organized through the `Trac-page
<http://ec2-23-20-90-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com/trac/>`_ of the project.
